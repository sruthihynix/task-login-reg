 1.   Use forms.Form when:

    The form doesn't directly map to a database model.
    You need flexibility to define fields and custom logic (e.g., a login form, contact form).

    Use forms.ModelForm when:

    The form is directly tied to a model.
    You want to automatically manage form fields based on the model and simplify saving/updating database instances.
2. user = form.save(commit=False)
3. {{ form.as_p }} is a Django template tag used to render a form's fields as <p> elements in HTML.
    Each field in the form is wrapped in a <p> tag, along with its label and any associated error messages.
     It's a quick and convenient way to render forms in a simple and readable format.
    Use {{ form.as_p }} when you want a simple and functional form layout,
    but switch to custom rendering if you need more control over the design.
